# Object-Detection-with-OpenCV
This project demonstrates object detection using the YOLOv3 model and OpenCV. The implementation includes detecting objects in images and real-time video processing, providing bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.

## Features
* Object detection on images using YOLOv3
* Real-time object detection on videos
* Integration with Google Colab for easy setup and execution
* Detailed documentation and step-by-step instructions

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/tafartech/object-detection-yolov3-opencv.git
cd object-detection-yolov3-opencv

2. Open Google Colab:

* Upload the notebook to your Google Colab account.
* Mount your Google Drive to access and store data.
3. Install Dependencies:
The notebook will handle the installation of necessary dependencies, such as OpenCV, automatically.

## Usage
1. Run the Notebook:

* Open the notebook in Google Colab.
* Follow the step-by-step instructions to execute each cell.
2. Object Detection on Image:

* Load and display the input image.
* Perform object detection using the YOLOv3 model.
* Visualize the detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

3. Real-time Object Detection on Video:

* Initialize video capture (webcam or video file).
* Apply the YOLOv3 model to each frame for real-time detection.
* Save and download the output video with detected objects.

  This project provides a solid foundation for further experimentation and enhancement, such as integrating different models, fine-tuning parameters, and optimizing performance for real-time applications.
