# Object-Detection-with-OpenCV
This project involves identifying and locating objects within an image using OpenCV and pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or R-CNN. The objective is to use a pre-trained object detection model to detect various objects in an image, such as people, vehicles, and more.
